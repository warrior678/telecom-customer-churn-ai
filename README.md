## 📈 Key Analytical Findings
- Overall customer churn rate is approximately **26.5%**
- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** show significantly higher churn (~45.8%)
- Customers in their **first 12 months** have the highest churn (~47.4%)
- Churn decreases consistently as **tenure increases**
- Long-term contracts (1–2 years) are strongly associated with **lower churn**

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Executive Insights
Generative AI was used **after manual analysis** to convert numerical findings into **business-friendly insights and recommendations**.

### Key Business Drivers
- Low-commitment plans (month-to-month) increase churn risk
- Poor early-stage customer experience drives first-year churn
- Long-term contracts create customer lock-in and stability

### Actionable Recommendations
- Incentivize customers to migrate to long-term contracts
- Strengthen onboarding and engagement in the first 12 months
- Proactively target high-risk customers with retention offers
